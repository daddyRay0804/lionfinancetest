## 1. Key Regulatory Bodies
- Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ): Sets monetary policy, Official Cash Rate (OCR), and LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio) restrictions for banks.
- Financial Markets Authority (FMA): Regulates financial advisers, FAPs (Financial Advice Providers), and ensures consumer protection in financial services.
- Commerce Commission: Enforces the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act (CCCFA) and Fair Trading Act.

## 2. Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act (CCCFA)
- The CCCFA is the main law governing consumer credit in NZ, updated significantly in December 2021.
- Lenders must conduct affordability assessments before approving loans — they must verify income, expenses, and existing debts.
- Responsible lending: Lenders must ensure the loan is suitable and affordable for the borrower. This includes checking living expenses, not just income.
- Borrowers have rights to clear disclosure of fees, interest rates, and loan terms before signing.
- Hardship provisions: Borrowers experiencing unexpected financial difficulty can apply to their lender for a hardship variation (e.g. reduced payments, payment holiday).
- Early repayment: Borrowers can repay loans early; the lender may charge a reasonable early repayment fee for fixed-rate loans (break cost).

## 3. LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio) Restrictions
- Set by the RBNZ to manage housing market risk.
- Owner-occupiers: Generally need at least 20% deposit (max 80% LVR). A small "speed limit" allows banks to lend a portion of new loans above 80% LVR.
- Investors: Generally need at least 35% deposit (max 65% LVR). Speed limit rules also apply.
- First-home buyers may access low-deposit lending through Kainga Ora First Home Loan scheme (5% deposit with conditions) or Welcome Home Loan.
- LVR rules change over time — always check current RBNZ settings.

## 4. Interest Rates in NZ
- Fixed rate: Locked for a set term (6 months to 5 years common). Provides certainty. Break costs may apply if repaid early or restructured.
- Floating/variable rate: Changes with market conditions. More flexible (extra repayments, early repay without break fees). Usually higher than fixed.
- Split loan: Part fixed, part floating — a popular strategy to balance certainty and flexibility.
- Capped rate: Rare, but some lenders offer a maximum rate with floating flexibility.
- The OCR (Official Cash Rate) set by RBNZ influences all mortgage rates. When OCR rises, mortgage rates typically follow.

## 5. First Home Buyer Support
- KiwiSaver First Home Withdrawal: After 3+ years of contributing, members can withdraw most of their KiwiSaver balance (minus $1,000) toward a first home.
- First Home Grant (Kainga Ora): Up to $5,000 per person for existing homes or $10,000 for new builds (after 3+ years KiwiSaver contributions). Income and house price caps apply by region.
- First Home Loan (Kainga Ora): Allows purchase with as little as 5% deposit. Income caps and house price caps apply.
- Welcome Home Loan: Similar low-deposit scheme through selected lenders.

## 6. Pre-Approval Process
- Pre-approval (also called conditional approval or approval in principle) indicates how much a lender is willing to lend based on your financial situation.
- Typically valid for 60-90 days (varies by lender).
- Not a guarantee of final approval — final approval requires a satisfactory property valuation and confirmed details.
- Documents commonly needed: ID, proof of income (payslips, employment letter, or financials for self-employed), bank statements (3-6 months), details of existing debts and assets.

## 7. Settlement Process
- Unconditional agreement: Once all conditions (finance, building inspection, LIM report, valuation) are satisfied, the agreement becomes unconditional.
- Settlement day: The buyer's solicitor transfers funds to the seller's solicitor. The buyer receives the keys.
- Typical timeline from unconditional to settlement: 2-6 weeks (set in the sale and purchase agreement).
- Solicitor/conveyancer handles legal transfer of title and mortgage registration.

## 8. Construction Loans
- Funds are drawn down in stages (progress payments) as construction milestones are reached.
- Common stages: Foundation/slab, framing, roof on, fit-out, practical completion.
- Interest is usually charged only on the amount drawn (not the full loan) during construction — often on a floating rate.
- A registered valuer or the bank's assessor confirms each stage before the next draw-down.
- A fixed-price building contract is typically required by lenders.
- Council-issued Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is needed at completion.

## 9. Refinancing
- Switching your existing mortgage to a new lender for better rates or terms.
- Costs to consider: break fees (if leaving a fixed term early), legal fees, new lender application fees, and any cashback clawback from the current lender.
- Many lenders offer cash contributions (cashback) to attract refinance customers — but these may be clawed back if you leave within 3-4 years.
- A broker compares the market so you don't have to approach each bank individually.

## 10. Investment Property Lending
- Higher deposit required (typically 35%+ due to LVR rules for investors).
- Rental income is assessed (usually at 65-80% of gross rent) to help with serviceability.
- Interest deductibility: NZ tax law changes (phased in from 2021) have limited or removed interest deductions for residential investment properties. New builds may still qualify. Check with a tax advisor.
- Bright-line test: Property sold within a set period (currently 2 years for new builds acquired after July 2024, or properties acquired before specific dates may have longer periods) may be subject to income tax on gains. Rules have changed multiple times — always confirm current bright-line period.

## 11. Business and Commercial Lending
- Assessed differently from residential: focuses on business cash flow, profitability, and asset security.
- Security can include commercial property, residential property, business assets, or personal guarantees.
- Interest rates are typically higher than residential.
- Loan terms may be shorter (5-15 years) with more frequent reviews.
- GST implications may apply on commercial property transactions.

## 12. Anti-Money Laundering (AML/CFT)
- The AML/CFT Act 2009 requires financial advisers and lenders to verify customer identity (Know Your Customer / KYC).
- Customers must provide valid photo ID and proof of address.
- Source of funds or source of wealth may need to be demonstrated for larger transactions.
- This is a legal requirement — not optional.

## 13. Financial Adviser Duties (under Financial Markets Conduct Act)
- Financial advisers must act in the client's best interest, exercise care, diligence, and skill.
- Must give priority to the client's interests if there's a conflict.
- Must disclose: their licence, scope of advice, fees/commissions, any conflicts of interest.
- Licensed FAPs (like Lion Finance) are regulated by the FMA.

## 14. Dispute Resolution
- All financial service providers must belong to an approved dispute resolution scheme.
- Lion Finance is a member of the Financial Dispute Resolution Service (FDRS).
- Consumers can complain to FDRS for free if they cannot resolve an issue with their adviser directly.
- FDRS contact: 0508 337 337, www.fdrs.org.nz

## 15. Insurance Related to Lending
- Life insurance / mortgage protection: Not legally required but strongly recommended. Covers the mortgage if the borrower dies or becomes critically ill.
- House insurance: Required by all lenders as a condition of the mortgage — must be in place at settlement.
- Contents insurance: Not required by lenders but recommended.
- Income protection: Covers mortgage payments if borrower cannot work due to illness or injury.

## 16. Fees and Costs in a Property Purchase
- Deposit (usually 10% at agreement, rest at settlement; distinguish from LVR deposit which is equity)
- Legal/conveyancing fees: $1,500-$3,000+
- Building inspection: $400-$800
- Registered valuation: $600-$1,000 (may be covered by lender)
- LIM report (from council): $200-$400
- Loan application fee: $0-$500 (varies by lender; often waived through a broker)
- Mortgage registration fee (government): ~$200
- Moving costs, rates adjustments, utility connections

## 17. Foreign Buyer Restrictions (Overseas Investment Act)
- Non-residents and non-citizens generally cannot purchase existing residential property in NZ (Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018).
- Exceptions: Australian and Singaporean citizens/residents (due to free trade agreements), certain visa holders.
- New builds: Overseas buyers may purchase new apartments/units in developments of 20+ units (with conditions).
- NZ residents (including work visa holders with 12+ months remaining) can generally purchase.
- Always check current rules with a solicitor.

## 18. Privacy Act 2020
- Governs how personal information is collected, used, stored, and disclosed.
- Clients have the right to access and correct their personal information held by advisers and lenders.
- Mandatory breach reporting: Organisations must notify the Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals of serious privacy breaches.
